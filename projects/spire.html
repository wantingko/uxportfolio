    <p>Before digging into redesigning GradeCraft Badges, I poked through the current site and pulled up the interaction sitemap made by our user researchers to better understand how it works.</p>
    <p>Thinking in isolation does not help. I reached out to my mentor Sophia and met our associate director Cait with a list of questions related to current features and ideas to improve user experience. From the talks, I was able to locate user needs and prioritize features.</p>

    <p>Now that I have located user needs and prioritized MVP features, it’s time to transform information gathered into new user flows for the redesigned version of GradeCraft Badges. The following are 3 design goals for Badges Redesign. I started off with creating potential new user flows with notes scattered on Illustrator to keep a record of new, but sometimes wild, ideas. </p>

    <!-- 5. design & iterations -->
    <div class="section">
        <h4>design & iterations</h4>
        <h1 id="spire-title">Feedback, Inspirations, and Improvements</h1>
        <p>Instructor facing prototypes have gone through 15+ iterations and student facing ones are currently under the 5th iteration. From weekly design work review with my mentor Sophia, I learnt best practices in naming Illustrator artboards and layers to help another designer understand the logic behind different interactions. From 3+ rounds of redesign meetings with our associate director Cait, I gained experience presenting design work to a non-designer and got inspiration from different points of view. And finally, from 2+ meetings with behavioral scientist Holly, I realized the power of language and how it helps the UI shine. Below listed 3 of the many design decisions I have made with my mentor. </p>

        <h2>1. Instructor Badges Setup: Displaying the Badge Icon Library in a separate modal</h2>
        <p>In GradeCraft redesign, the team wanted to introduce a new badge library feature to users. In the first version, badges were ordered in lists under the General Info tab. Because of the limited space, badge icons were not as visible. Thus, after discussing with my mentor, we decided to enlarge the icons and move them to a modal. The new interaction requires one additional click, but has a greater potential to nudge users to try out our new badge icon collection.</p>

        <div class="img-des">Displaying the Badge Icon Library in a separate modal</div>

        <h2>2. Instructor Badges Coursework: Organize badge award summaries using blocks in expanded accordions</h2>
        <p>List of badge award summaries in expanded accordions worked well when there are only a few awards to a student. However, a student can possibly earn a badge several times. In that scenario, the expanded accordion will become overcrowded and less visible. Based on the finding, my mentor and I agreed on displaying the information in blocks and keeping the buttons under the dot UI. </p>

        <div class="img-des">Using blocks to display badge summaries in expanded accordions</div>

        <h2>3. Student Badges: Simplify overview panel information in Student Badge details page</h2>
        <p>In the current badge details page, there are no overview panels. All information is listed on the page. The green panel in version 1 provides a quick and focused overview of a student’s progress towards the goal. However, after presenting the mockups with the project director, we decided not to include the entire idea of “in progress” in Badges. From that, I worked with my mentor to create a more simplified version of the overview panel.

  <!-- 9. conclusion and future notes -->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>reflection</h4>
    <h1 id="spire-title">Things I’d Like to Keep in Mind</h1>
    <h2>Questions are street lights in the dark</h2>
    <p>Redesigning an entire feature for GradeCraft / Spire is challenging but rewarding. During the process, I sometimes feel that I am only seeing a part of the system and might have missed some user scenarios or design decisions made in the past. Asking questions, and many of them, has helped me tremendously in understanding the system holistically and catching tiny bugs in current and previous redesigns. 
    </p>
    <h2>There's no final version</h2>
    <p>I got this from my mentor Sophia and now believe that there’s no such thing as “final version” in design. Feedback from peer designers, new findings from user research, and inspiration from different roles all drive continuing iterations that refines user experience. In short, iterations do not stop and that is a natural and ongoing process.</p>
