    <h4>project overview</h4>
    <h1>how the story begins...</h1>
    <p>People care about the environment and are eager to contribute by building an eco-friendly lifestyle. However, developing sustainable habits alone is never easy. From 10 in-depth interviews with potential users, we found people feel helpless, lonely, and unmotivated in this journey. Thus, we would like to present a mobile app idea that gamifies traditional habit-forming experiences. Our solution, CHANGE, offers structured steps with tips to help users achieve personal goals, visualizes their achievements in journey maps, and motivates them through team challenges that bring in communities to support them along the way.</p>

        <p>The feature sets up a stage for users who would like to keep goals personal. Not everyone enjoys competitions, and we hear that. Personal challenges nudge people to reflect on their journeys through self-ratings. To connect the virtual experience with people’s daily life, we propose real-world rewards as incentives to motivate them more.</p>

    <h2>In-depth Interviews</h2>
    <p>To understand people’s thoughts on sustainability and their current lifestyles, we interviewed ten potential users representing different stages of life, academic focuses, and cultural backgrounds. Participants include 1 Korean, 1 Chinese, 3 Taiwanese, and 5 Americans. All are between 20-50 years old and living in the USA.</p> 
    <p>Before conducting the interviews, we worked on interview protocols that focused on participants’ lunch journeys with three different overarching questions:</p>

    <img src="../assets/img/change-protocols.png" alt="">
    <div class="img-des">Interview protocols we developed together</div>

    <p>We started each interview with more general questions inquiring about the participant’s prior experience in practicing sustainable habits. Based on that response, we made a quick decision to place the participant into one of the 3 following groups: people who are unfamiliar with the concept of sustainability and rarely practice sustainable habits (Group A), people who are fully aware and are actively practicing sustainable habits (Group C), and those who are somewhere in-between (Group B). The result led each participant to different follow-up questions designed for specific groups.</p>

    <div class="img-des">Questions tailored to different groups of participants</div>

    <h2>Affinity Wall</h2>
    <p>After conducting the interviews, we collected insights gathered from participants and created affinity notes on yellow digital post-its during team interpretation sessions. We first clustered the notes with similar concepts to larger groups and gave each of them a red post-it with a summary of the group. We repeated this process several times until the trend and structure unfolded.</p>

    <h4>ideation and design goals</h4>
    <h1 id="change-title">what we want to achieve</h1>
    <p>Considering that our interviewees are mostly in their 20s and 30s, we decided to narrow down our target users to college students and young professionals for they have more control over making decisions on preferable lifestyles. According to our findings, we came up with the following goals that we want our design to achieve:</p>
    <div class="proj-content-card-container">
      <div class="proj-content-card" id="change-card-bg">
        <h1 id="change-title">1.</h1>
        <p>Design an intriguing and enlightening experience of habit formation</p>

      <div class="proj-content-card" id="change-card-bg">
        <h1 id="change-title">2.</h1>

      <div class="proj-content-card" id="change-card-bg">

        <p>Develop systematic plans that introduce users ways to lead a more environmentally friendly lifestyle</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Having the above in mind, we brainstormed and sketched to visualize our ideas. Among the 15 solutions, we picked the ones that have great potential to entertain, help users build sustainable habits effectively, and connect them to support each other.</p>

  <!-- 6. iterations -->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>design</h4>
    <h1 id="change-title">fleshing out ideas and refining them</h1>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>In the stage of constructing wireframes, we created several versions of each interaction. During our meetings, we gave each other feedback and ran initial user tests to see which meet users' needs and are more intuitive.</p>
    <p>Internal design critiques and feedback from micro-usability tests helped us make the following three design decisions.</p>
    <img src="../assets/img/change-wireframe.png" alt="">
    <div class="img-des">Wireframes we created using Figma Team</div>

    <h2>Design decisions and iterations</h2>

    <h3>Design decision 1: Tap to view a group challenge</h3>
    <P>Displaying all challenge cards at once might make users more thrilled by the popularity of people practicing sustainable habits together. However, if more than 4-5 group challenges are on users’ screens at the same time, it becomes difficult to see the map itself. As a compromise, we decided to keep all group challenge locations but show details only when users tap the icons.</P>
    <img src="../assets/img/change-design-changes-1.png" alt="">
    <div class="img-des">Tap to explore group challenge details</div>

    <h3>Design decision 2: Limit information displayed in Map View and show details later</h3>
    <p>Since the size of each challenge card is limited, we decided to show partial information such as the title of the challenges only. Also, we hope the mobile app can not only help people build sustainable habits but also educate them. Thus, I proposed to add a short paragraph about the concepts behind each act and show progress bars to motivate users to participate in group challenges.</p>
    <img src="../assets/img/change-design-changes-2.png" alt="">
    <div class="img-des">Balance information displayed on Map view and Journey view</div>

    <h3>Design decision 3: Merging personal and group challenges</h3>
    <p>After simplifying the content displayed on group challenge cards, Map View became more visually appealing as it shows just the right amount of information. To implement the idea across the entire design system, we agreed to merge personal accomplishment and group challenge icons so that users do not have to jump between two different Map pages.</p>

  <!-- 8. conclusion and future notes -->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>takeaways</h4>
    <h1 id="change-title">Team building is the foundation of a good product</h1>
    <p>Product design requires different expertise, and working in a psychologically safe team where people care about each other makes the process less daunting. When we started in early October, we quickly realized that since participating in the CHI Game Competition was not mandatory, people are free to decide how much effort and time they would like to devote. At first, the team experienced several times people not showing up in meetings and leaving the project group entirely without notifying others. To better support the team, I developed a habit of sending messages to people who did not show up in meetings to show that we value their participation and would like to provide help if possible. It turned out that the strategy worked out well. The number of team members stopped decreasing, and we were finally able to push forward. </p>
