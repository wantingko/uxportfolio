    <div class="block-container">
      <h2>Task 1</h2>
      <p>Improving login flows</p>
      <p>Design goal: Less clicks and a more straightforward login experience</p>
    </div>
    <p>Before the new login flows were implemented, all users, including superusers, institutional managers, coach managers, coach assistants, and students went through unnecessary clicks to reach the page where they visit frequently. To ease the burden, I investigated different permission levels and collected user behavior information to come up with recommended login flows that more efficiently bring users to their destinations.</p>

      <h2>Task 2</h2>
      <p>Redesigning characteristics and featured tags</p>
      <p>Design goal: User friendly UI that self-explains states of table items</p>
    </div>
    <p>ECoach allows admin users to tailor messages, assignments, exam playbooks, and surveys. However, feature tags and characteristic tags were not intuitive due to both styling and naming. To solve this, I created multiple icons and tried out different color groups and decided to go with the design that uses the megaphone icon to highlight featured items, and color-coded bars to display wired/partially wired/unwired status. When users hover over each row, they would get more information about what characteristics are wired to MTS and what are not.</p>

      <h2>Task 3</h2>
      <p>Creating empty state of coaches</p>
      <p>Design goal: Intuitive and informative empty state illustration and copy</p>
    </div>
    <p>Previous empty state of coaches was text-based, telling users that we are sorry for they are not in any coaches at the moment. This conveyed the right information, but was not ideal. The word “sorry” carries multiple meanings and could be misinterpreted. Visually, the message was straightforward but cold. Thus, in the redesign, I added illustrations matched with ECoach branding and adjusted the copy and overall layout of the empty state to make the message stand out more.</p>

  <!-- 9. conclusion and future notes -->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>reflection</h4>
    <h1 id="ecoach-title">Things I’d Like to Keep in Mind</h1>
    <p>ECoach is a massive system having five permission levels and various tailoring methods. I started off the tasks underestimating efforts needed before I could even begin to brainstorm, ideate, and design. There were times when I felt like one of the blind men with the elephant. I thought I understood what a great login experience should look like, but I failed to consider all levels of permission. I assumed it would be a simple solution to apply two new icons to replace the feature tag and characteristic tag, but overlooked how complicated the tables were already. Thanks to my mentor, Kristen’s guidance, I was able to get a thorough understanding of how the complex system works. And that helped me make better design decisions.</p>
