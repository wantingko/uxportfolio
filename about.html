    <h1>The journey</h1>
    <h2>Literatures, languages, and learning</h2>
    <p>I have always wanted to become a high school teacher. In the last year of my college days, when I was not sitting in classrooms studying Literatures and imagining what Shakespeare and Milton would say if they were also in the lectures, I was probably on my way to attend classroom observations in local high schools. </p>
    <h2>In love with designing learning experiences</h2>
    <p>After college, I was fortunate enough to achieve my childhood dream. I love designing learning experiences to empower learners and enjoy crafting pixel perfect slides and worksheets. The days were a mixture of sweet and sour moments. I like what I am doing, but I hope I can make a greater impact. It was painful to accept the truth that it’s impossible to fully support each and every learner.</p>
    <h2>From education to Product Design</h2>
    <p>After work, I biked to nearby universities to audit evening courses. I started with a Project Oriented Programming course and a Human-Computer Interaction course. The experience unfolded a new ground where people, design, and development are tightly connected to solve complicated problems in the world. The more I explore, the more I am fascinated by the approach.</p>

    <h4>outside of work</h4>
    <h1 id="poem">When I'm not with my computer...</h1>
    <p>In spring</p>
    <p>I watch goslings and ducklings waddling with their family</p>
    <p>I chuckle when they are lost in other babysitting groups accidentally</p>
    <p>In summer</p>
    <p>I imagine soaking myself in cool water with Capybara</p>
    <p>I wake up from dream when I hear greetings from Kookaburra</p>
    <p>In autumn</p>
    <p>I spy on chipmunks hiding acorns in the ground</p>
    <p>I grin cheerfully when they suddenly turn around</p>
    <p>In winter</p>
    <p>I investigate mysterious footprints left one the snow</p>
    <p>I scream with joy when I see the secret visitor show</p>
